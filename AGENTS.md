# Agent Instructions

## Issue tracking

This project uses **dcat** for issue tracking. You MUST run `dcat prime --opinionated` for instructions.
Then run `dcat list --agent-only` to see the list of issues. Generally we work on bugs first, and always on high priority issues first.

When running multiple `dcat` commands, make separate parallel Bash tool calls instead of chaining them with `&&` and `echo` separators.

Mark each issue `in_progress` right when you start working on it — not before. Set `in_review` when work on that issue is done before moving on. The status should reflect what you are *actually* working on right now.

It is okay to work on multiple related issues at the same time, but do NOT batch-mark an entire backlog as `in_progress` upfront. If there is a priority conflict, ask the user which to focus on first.

If the user brings up a new bug, feature or anything else that warrants changes to the code, ALWAYS ask if we should create an issue for it before you start working on the code. When creating issues, set appropriate labels using `--labels` based on the issue content (e.g. `cli`, `tui`, `api`, `docs`, `testing`, `refactor`, `ux`, `performance`, etc.).

When research or discussion produces findings relevant to an existing issue, ask these as **separate questions in order**:

1. First ask: "Should I update issue [id] with these findings?"
2. Only after that, separately ask: "Should I start working on the implementation?"
Do NOT combine these into one question. The user may want to update the issue without starting work.

### Closing Issues - IMPORTANT

NEVER close issues without explicit user approval. When work is complete:

1. Set status to `in_review`: `dcat update --status in_review $issueId`
2. Ask the user to test
3. Ask if we can close it: "Can I close issue [id] '[title]'?"
4. Only run `dcat close` after user confirms
